Cubic Biezer Easing
===============

###What is a Cubic Beizer?
--------------------------

*Cubic Beizers* are a family of curves which are used widely in the field of Computer Graphics. With their help we can simulate various easing animations.
They can be represented uniquely by a set of 4 points, as shown in the animation below:
